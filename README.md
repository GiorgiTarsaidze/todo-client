# Todo App

This is the frontend client for a Todo App project, designed to work in conjunction with a [Django REST framework (DRF) backend](https://github.com/GiorgiTarsaidze/todo-server): 
The frontend is responsible for creating, updating, and managing tasks, as well as providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with their to-do list.
This frontend client communicates with a Django REST framework (DRF) backend to fetch, create, update, and delete tasks. Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible for full functionality.

## Features 
- Create new tasks with checkboxes.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete individual tasks.
- Filter tasks by "All," "Active," or "Completed."
- Clear completed tasks in one click.
- Dark mode for better user experience.
